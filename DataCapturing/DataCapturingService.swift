/**
 An object of this class handles the lifecycle of starting and stopping data capturing as well as transmitting results to an appropriate server.
 
 - Author: Klemens Muthmann
 - Version: 1.0.0
 - Since: 1.0.0
 
 To avoid using the users traffic or incurring costs, the service waits for Wifi access before transmitting any data. You may however force synchronization if required, using `forceSyncU()`.
 
 An object of this class is not thread safe and should only be used once per application. Youmay start and stop the service as often as you like and reuse the object.
