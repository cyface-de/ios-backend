 Objects of this class represent the current disk (or rather SD card) space used and available.

 - Version:
 1.0.0
 
 - Since:
 1.0.0
 
 This space is mostly filled with unsynchronized `Measurement`s. To avoid filling up the users SD card it is advisable to delte `Measurement`s as soon as they use up too much space.
